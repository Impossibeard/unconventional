<h1>Welcome to Unconventional</h1>
<br>
<p>Filmmaker looking for the right costume designer for your Steampunk Horror movie?
Writer looking for artists and colorists for a comic book idea?
Programmer looking for sprite designers?</p>
 <br>
<p>Unconventional is the answer to the giant looming question that plagues collaborators across all fields: "Could my finished product be better if I actually had the right people on the project?"</p>
 <br>
<p>Conventions have sprung up everywhere as an attempt to answer that question, however there is still an element of serendipity left to it. What if you aren't great in social situations? What if you are geographically unable to make the right contacts you need?</p>
 <br>
<p>Unconventional's goal is to finally allow an individual's work to speak for itself. You can post your portfolio online and search for others to collaborate with. Find the people who will truly make your project come alive. </p>
